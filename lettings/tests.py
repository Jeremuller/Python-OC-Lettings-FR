"""
Integration tests for the `lettings` Django application.

These tests validate the behavior of the application by exercising
the full request/response cycle of the Django stack:

    URL routing → View execution → Database access → Template rendering → HTTP response

Unlike unit tests that focus on isolated components (models, views, or URLs),
integration tests ensure that multiple layers of the application work together
correctly when accessed through real HTTP requests.

The following scenarios are covered:

Happy paths:
    - Accessing the lettings index page successfully
    - Displaying existing lettings in the index page
    - Navigating to the detail page of a specific letting
    - Displaying letting address information correctly

Edge cases:
    - Rendering the index page when no lettings exist

Sad paths (TDD approach):
    - Requesting a letting that does not exist should return HTTP 404

Some tests intentionally document expected future behavior such as
proper 404 error handling. These tests may initially fail until the
application implements the appropriate error management.

This approach follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
